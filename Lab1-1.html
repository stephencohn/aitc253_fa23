            <h3>Lecture Notes For Class On 05SEPT2023</h3>
                <li>Today's class was on the basics of webpage designs. We talked about how to 
                    start the code and the site. One of the things talked about was how to 
                    add headers to the page. We do that by typing h followed a number 1-6 inside angle brackets, 
                    inserting your title, then closing it out with /h followed by the same number inside angle brackets.</li>

                <li>Another thing we learned is how to make paragraphs. Creating a paragraph is 
                    similar to creating a header. Except we put p and /p inside the angle brackets.</li>
                <li>We also learned that we can create bulletins. The process for that is the exact 
                    same as the paragraphs. However, instead of placing p and /p inside the angle 
                    brackets, we put li and /li. </li>
                <li>On the lab handout, it shows that we can use ol or ul inside angle brackets to make
                    lists. ol is an organized list, and ul is an unorganized list.</li>
                <ol>
                <h4>Let's put a summary of what was learned so far into an organized list such as this one.</h4>
                <li>Type h 1-6 and close out with /h 1-6 inside angle brackets to make a header.</li>
                <li>Type p 1-6 and close out with /p 1-6 inside angle brackets to make a paragraph.</li>
                <li>Type li and close out with /li inside angle brackets to make a list.</li>
                <li>Use ol and ul to make organized or unorganized lists.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <h4>Here is an unorganized list of random words.</h4>
                <li>Envelope</li>
                <li>Flask</li>
                <li>Computer</li>
                <li>Peppermint</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, organized lists creates a list with numbers.
